# Fabric Fault Detection for Industrial Quality Check

This project leverages computer vision and deep learning to detect faults in fabric for industrial quality control. The system is built using the YOLOv8 model, which has been custom trained on a dataset of fabric images. The web application is deployed using **Streamlit** for real-time detection and visualization.
## About
This system aims to assist in industrial fabric inspection by detecting fabric defects, ensuring quality control and reducing manual labor. It utilizes the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection model, which has been trained on a custom dataset to recognize various types of fabric faults. The app provides a user-friendly interface via **Streamlit** for real-time fault detection.

## Technologies
- **YOLOv8**: Custom-trained deep learning model for object detection.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for creating interactive web applications.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing and manipulation.
- **Python**: Programming language for model training and app development.
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework used for training the YOLOv8 model.
